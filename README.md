# Manage-Accounts-GUI
In this project I have used Python's sqlite3 library in creating a database containing tables like debit (debit from a particular account), credit(credit to a particular account). Data can be fetched in various ways like showing total debit and total credit of all accounts, debit and credit details of a particular account with the date of transaction, display all accounts, etc. the App also contains a feature of deleting accounts, debit and credit. In this project I have used SQL features like joins and group functions.The front end was made using Python's Tkinter Library.
